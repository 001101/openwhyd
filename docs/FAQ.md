### The player says “Embed too small” or something like that, and wont play my music! 
 
Yeah, this happens, the embed is about as small as it can be without breaking the rules, but that sometimes means that when people have a zoom on their browser that the window is too small to play the media. Check the “View” tab and set it to 100%, that should fix the problem in most cases. 
 
### Sometimes a track doesn’t play at all, or it says that I have to go to YouTube to view the content.
 
Well, it’s true, there is some music that cannot be embedded onto other sites without explicit permission from the rights holders. If we don’t have an agreement in place you have to go to YouTube to watch it. But don’t worry, we are working on a bunch of solutions to that very problem! 
 
Other times the player is trying to activate the media but the connection slows down for whatever reason and the play action times out. In this case the player skips to the next song. Try clicking on the song that was skipped, most of the time it will start playing. This problem comes from the fact that with continuous playback there are certain conditions that must be set to make sure that your music doesn’t get stuck on a track that’s acting a little unruly. 
 
But overall keep in mind that we support music from a lot of different sources, and these sources are continuously evolving and changing, so we strive to make 99% of tracks work, and we are definitely hitting our goal!
 
### When I click on a track it takes me to the Soundcloud page! 
 
That happens too, try refreshing the Openwhyd page. 
 
### The video plays on top of the notifications panel!
 
Yeah, that’s because of Flash. Please try again after activating the HTML5 mode of Youtube (http://youtube.com/html5), and contact us if you still experience this issue.
 
### Other: I have a problem that you didn’t mention here, what should I do about it?
 
Contact us at contact@openwhyd.org, or through our [Openwhyd Music Lovers Club, on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/openwhyd/). Our community of volunteers and users will do their best to help!
